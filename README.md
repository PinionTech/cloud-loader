cloud-loader
============

Helper tool to get stuff into Rackspace Cloud Files

This is an internal tool we use at Pinion. We have a machine that has loadcloud.sh in an every-minute cronjob to upload any new files it finds. You could also probably use cloud-loader.coffee as a git hook and it would be pretty great.
